# Parallel Compression
#### what is it and how to use it

\

Compression is a powerful tool in audio production, but like any tool it can be
constructive and it can be destructive. To make this tool work for you it is important to define
what it SHOULD do. Obviously, a compressor reduces the dynamic range of the program
material, that is a given, but how that is achieved is crucial in deciding the quality of the finished
product. So, we can use parallel compression to get a lot of dynamic range compression
without introduction obvious 'pumping' or volume artifacts into the audio. The result, if done
correctly, is natural sounding and punchy because the transient structure of the original audio is
largely preserved.

The basic concept behind parallel compression is to have a highly compressed version
of the program material in parallel with the uncompressed signal. These two signal paths are
summed together on their own. Traditionally, the two signal paths contain the exact same mix
of elements. For example, in a drum mix using parallel compression the snare, kick, overheads,
etc. are all balanced the same in the compressed and uncompressed signal paths.
Furthermore, the uncompressed signal typically does not contain ANY processing that the
compressed signal does not (other than compression obviously). This is not to say that you
cannot decide to apply some equalization to the uncompressed signal, however it requires a
complete understanding of parallel compression as a tool and how to properly implement it for a
given piece of audio.

This brings us to where the rubber meets the road, so to speak; the compressor. What
compressor should I use? How do it set it up and how should I set it differently from in-line
compression? When you are using a compressor in parallel you essentially want to hear the
compressed signal most when the original audio is quiet. Conversely, you want to hear the
uncompressed audio most when it is loudest, since it is the more dynamic of the two signals. In
this way you are trying to replace the transients of the compressed audio with the original tracks
audio, so you are left with a signal that has a natural transient response but the dynamic range
is still reduced because the quiet parts that normally go unheard are brought up by the
compressed signal.

If you can really understand this concept you can almost always figure out what the
best attack and release times for your compressor should be. It is all dependent on the
transients of the audio. For the most common use case for parallel compression, drums, you
need extremely fast attack and release times, because drum sounds typically attack and decay
very fast, especially compared to something like a vocal performance.

An important thing to notice here is the temporal frame of reference for your
compressor in any given parallel compression scenario. For something like drums, you typically
want the audio to cross the threshold for your parallel bus compressor every time the kick or
snare is hit. That means you need very fast attack and release times. For drums I generally
assume with an attack time of less than 5 milliseconds I am catching the majority of the
transient, although faster is better in this case. The release time is always a little bit more
tricky. If you are using a compressor that has a VU for gain reduction metering you can watch it
and adjust the release so that it ‘feels’ like it is on rhythm with the song, since the ballistics of
the needly aren’t exactly analogous to what the compressor is doing at that exact moment. If
you have a digital compressor and can see exactly what the compressor is doing, having the
recovery of the compressor act similarly to the decay of the individual drum hits in the recording
is a good place to start.

The other common use case for parallel compression is on a vocal. In this case your
compressor should be working with larger sections of time. You still want a fast attack but the
release time is going to be much longer than for drums. In some cases, the vocal might not
cross the threshold of the parallel bus compressor at all in an entire section of a song. But,
when the performance gets loud there should be a lot of compression and it should decay in
time with the performance itself.

Parallel compression and be a powerful tool for anyone that takes the time to fully
understand the concept of how to use it.
