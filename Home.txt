This is a blog all about audio.  It is a place for my thoughts on everything from mixing
and mastering music to hifi audio and the listening experience.

#### About Me

I have been making and engineering music professionally for 10 years.  I graduated from Belmont University
with a Bachelor's of Science in Audio Engineering and Technology and continued to make music and
help others in the music making process.  I have experience with many large format analog mixing consoles,
and just about every type of signal processor outhere.  Part of being good at making music is
knowing the ins and outs of a varietry of instruments; how they are played, how they make
sound and what makes them sound good.  I have taken a particualar interest in live drums,
synthesizers and guitars.  Being a fan of music in general has also pushed me to find better ways
of enjoying listening to music, and I have many thoughts on hifi sound, speakers, headphones, etc.
