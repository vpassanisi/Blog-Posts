# A Digital Prophet 5 Synthesizer

\

This is a basic in browser recreation of the Oscilator, Filter, and Amplifier sections of the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5. The Prophet 5 is one of the most infuential synthesizers in the hisory of music.  It was the first to implement many features like presets and midi that we take for granted now in every synthesier on the market.  On top of all the inovation in the Prophet 5, it had a huge warm sound that everyone has come to love.


This recreation was built with the Tone.js library for the
audio generation and manipulation.  The Oscilators have a few
extra waveforms than the original synthesizer and the "Amount"
knob functions slightly different than the original in that is 
setts the desination value for the attack frequency of the filter, rather than the amplitude of the filter ADSR envelope.  The real Prophet 5 had many features but this recreation is of the core synthesizer sections.

This synthesizer was an exploration of what is possible with
audio in the browser.  Tone.js is a large library and gives you
many options in terms of routing and parameters for you to create and manipulate sound.  I think the downsides to working with audio in the browser is the latency.  There are audio projects that are not sensitive to latency, like a DAW, that I think can find success in the browser but with an instrument that you are going to play in real time you may run into some problems when developing in the browser.
